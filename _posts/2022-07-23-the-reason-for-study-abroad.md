# Background

I started studying computer science at the age of 9. I loved whatever to do with a computer. My parents worked all day, so I used to play video games after school. Still, my parents didn't let me play video games, so I began to study computer science.

I followed the online lecture step by step. Firstly, I studied javascript. I chose javascript because perhaps I felt the name was cool. I learned how to use the console.log() function, which was so funny! Also, my parents let me study computer science. I was so excited that I could use a computer all day!

# Felt limited in studying in Korea

Korean students are famous for their large amount of studying. There is even a saying, "Four hours of sleep passes, and five hours of sleep fails." Still, I felt that I couldn't study **what I wanted** - computer science. There are few curriculums where I can learn computer science. Also, the quality of the lectures is not good. Therefore, I felt limited in studying in Korea.

# Limitation of working in Korea

There are few kinds of races in Korea, so there is a limit to having many experiences. I thought it would be disadvantage to build my career. Also, I wanted to work at a big company such as Google. Google is my dream company to work at.
